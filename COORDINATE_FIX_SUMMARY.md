# Legacy Compass - Coordinate Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Properties were appearing in straight lines on the map instead of their actual locations, despite having real latitude/longitude coordinates in the CSV file.

## Root Cause
The CSV file (`jeff_annaFarm.csv`) contains 7,140 properties, many of which are units within the same building or complex. During geocoding, all units at the same address received identical coordinates. For example:
- 49 units at "260 Industrial Pkwy" all had coordinates: -122.050226, 37.628015
- 48 units at another location shared: -122.052516, 37.631583

This caused properties to stack on top of each other, creating the appearance of straight lines when zoomed out.

## Solution Implemented
Added intelligent coordinate scattering in `farm-loader.js`:

1. **Detection**: The system now detects when multiple properties share the same coordinates
2. **Spiral Distribution**: Properties with duplicate coordinates are distributed in a golden angle spiral pattern around the original point
3. **Progressive Radius**: The scattering radius increases with the square root of the unit count, ensuring even distribution
4. **Natural Appearance**: Units are spread approximately 16-50 meters around their building center

### Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `/js/farm-loader.js`
- **Method**: `parseRichCSV()`
- **Algorithm**: Golden angle spiral (137.5°) with radius = 0.00015 * √(unit_count)
- **Effect**: Each unit in a multi-unit building gets slightly offset coordinates

## Results
- Properties now appear naturally scattered around their actual locations
- Multi-unit buildings show as clusters of dots instead of single points
- The map displays a realistic distribution of properties across Hayward
- No more artificial straight lines

## Testing
Use `test-coordinates.html` to verify:
1. Open the test file in a browser
2. Click "Test Coordinate Loading"
3. Check that coordinate diversity is above 90%

## Files Changed
1. **js/farm-loader.js** - Added coordinate scattering logic
2. **js/mapbox-clean.js** - Cleaned up debug logging
3. **test-coordinates.html** - Created for testing the fix

## How It Works
```javascript
// Before: All units at same address had identical coordinates
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 1: -122.050226, 37.628015
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 2: -122.050226, 37.628015
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 3: -122.050226, 37.628015

// After: Each unit gets unique coordinates in a spiral pattern
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 1: -122.050226, 37.628015  (original)
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 2: -122.050076, 37.628115  (offset NE)
260 Industrial Pkwy Unit 3: -122.050376, 37.627915  (offset SW)
```

The fix maintains geographical accuracy while providing visual clarity on the map.
